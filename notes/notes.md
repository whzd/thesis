In this PhD report presents an alternative approach to the extraction of relevant terms from text.
Since relevance of a term is not conceptual, the author proposes to extract all concepts, which have a less fuzzy nature, and let the downstream application decide the relevance of those concepts.
A concept in the text mining area consists of a word or sequence of words which possess semantic value.

Using a statistical and language independent approach for extraction of single-word and multi-word concepts, which the author called *ConceptExtractor*, was achieved values around 90% in **Precision** and **Recall**.
The limitations of this approach, that the author pointed out, are the fact that some multi-words concetps score high in their specificity, even though they might not be complete.

**Note:**

**Precision** is the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.

**Recall** is the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.

Notes:

In the generated definition of the concept, all the word need to be in the databases, so that the avatar can properly translated it to sign language.
