\section{Motivation}

In sign language when a user is faced with a word which he doesn't know he has to spell.
Take 'Nanotechnology' as an example, it would take this user 14 signs to reproduce this word.
But since the portuguese sign language lexicon is quite small, there are signs that represente a word or even a complete expression. 
If the user knew its definition he would need fewer signs to accomplish a translation, making the life of the 'speaker' and the 'listener' easier.

With this problem in mind, one member of the deaf community in portugal expressed the need for a system that was capable of generating an explanation of a given word or expression.
