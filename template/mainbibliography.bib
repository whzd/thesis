	Abstract = {We describe a data-driven approach for automatically explaining new, non-standard English expressions in a given sentence, building on a large dataset that includes 15 years of crowdsourced examples from UrbanDictionary.com. Unlike prior studies that focus on matching keywords from a slang dictionary, we investigate the possibility of learning a neural sequence-tosequence model that generates explanations of unseen non-standard English expressions given context. We propose a dual encoder approach—a word-level encoder learns the representation of context, and a second character-level encoder to learn the hidden representation of the target non-standard expression. Our model can produce reasonable definitions of new non-standard English expressions given their context with certain confidence.},

@article{Reference3,
	Abstract = {Distributed representations of words have been shown to capture lexical semantics, as demonstrated by their effectiveness in word similarity and analogical relation tasks. But, these tasks only evaluate lexical semantics indirectly. In this paper, we study whether it is possible to utilize distributed representations to generate dictionary definitions of words, as a more direct and transparent representation of the embeddings’ semantics. We introduce definition modeling, the task of generating a definition for a given word and its embedding. We present several definition model architectures based on recurrent neural networks, and experiment with the models over multiple data sets. Our results show that a model that controls dependencies between the word being defined and the definition words performs significantly better, and that a characterlevel convolution layer designed to leverage morphology can complement word-level embeddings. Finally, an error analysis suggests that the errors made by a definition model may provide insight into the shortcomings of word embeddings.},

@article{Reference4,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present a rule-based system for automatic extraction of definitions from Portuguese texts. As input, this system takes text that is previously annotated with morpho-syntactic information, namely on POS and inflection features. It handles three types of definitions, whose connector between definiendum and definiens is the so-called copula verb “to be”, a verb other that one, or punctuation marks. The primary goal of this system is to act as a tool for supporting glossary construction in e-learning management systems. It was tested using a collection of texts that can be taken as learning objects, in three different domains: information society, computer science for non experts, and e-learning. For each one of these domains and for each type of definition typology, evaluation results are presented. On average, we obtain 14\% for precision, 86\% for recall and 0.33 for F2 score.},
